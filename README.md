# Tiny Compiler

This project is a small compiler developed by **EvieLyra**.
It was created to help deepen my understanding of how compilers work.

## Overview

The Tiny Compiler currently includes the following components:
- **Parser:** Processes source code and builds an abstract syntax tree.
- **Lexer:** Tokenizes the source code into meaningful symbols.
- **Emitter:** A work-in-progress component aimed at generating C code from the parsed data.

*Note: The emitter is not yet finished and may not produce fully functional C code.*

## Usage

To get started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the project (instructions to be added).
3. Experiment with the parser and lexer modules.
